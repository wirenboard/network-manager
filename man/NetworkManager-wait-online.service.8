.SH "NAME"
NetworkManager-wait-online.service \- Wait for network to come online
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service delays network\-online\&.target until network is ready\&.
.PP
The systemd target
network\-online\&.target
acts as a synchronization point for services to start after network is configured\&. Such services should order themselves
After=network\-online\&.target
(and never
After=NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service)\&.
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
is a one\-shot service that itself is ordered
Before=network\-online\&.target
and this way delays the target until the network is configured\&.
.PP
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
itself is almost not configurable itself\&. Instead the connection profiles and configuration in NetworkManager affects the behavior\&.
.PP
In the best case, all services on the system can react to networking changes dynamically and no service orders itself after
network\-online\&.target\&. That way,
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
has no effect and, for example, does not delay the boot\&. That means, if the problem is a long boot time related to
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service, a possible solution is to investigate the services that claim to require network and fix those\&.
.PP
For services that require network configured,
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
is the default implementation provided by NetworkManager to delay the target\&. But it does nothing magical\&. With special requirements, it may be sensible to disable
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
and replace it with a similar service that better implements the requirement\&.
.PP
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
blocks until NetworkManager logs "startup complete" and announces startup complete on D\-Bus\&. How long that takes depends on the network and the NetworkManager configuration\&. If it takes longer than expected, then the reasons need to be investigated in NetworkManager\&.
.PP
There are various reasons what affects NetworkManager reaching "startup complete" and how long
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
blocks\&.

In general, startup complete is not reached as long as NetworkManager is busy activating a device and as long as there are profiles in activating state\&. During boot, NetworkManager starts autoactivating suitable profiles that are configured to autoconnect\&. If activation fails, NetworkManager might retry right away (depending on
connection\&.autoconnect\-retries
setting)\&. While trying and retrying, NetworkManager is busy until all profiles and devices either reached an activated or disconnected state and no further events are expected\&.

When a device reaches activated state, depends on its configuration\&. For example, with a profile with both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing enabled, the device is possibly considered fully activated when either of the address families is ready\&. This can be controlled with the
ipv4\&.may\-fail
and
ipv6\&.may\-fail
settings, to indicate that the address family is required\&. There are also
ipv4\&.required\-timeout
and
ipv6\&.required\-timeout
settings which affect how long to wait for an address family\&. Likewise, properties like
ipv4\&.dhcp\-timeout
and
ipv6\&.ra\-timeout
affect how long NetworkManager will try the IP configuration before giving up\&.

For example, a bridge or bond profile cannot do IP configuration without ports\&. When booting with such profiles that autoactivate without ports,
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
blocks until timeout\&. This is a configuration error\&.

The property
connection\&.wait\-device\-timeout
of the connection profiles waits until the waited devices appear\&. This is useful if the driver takes a longer time to detect the networking interfaces\&.

With Wi\-Fi devices, NetworkManager needs to wait for the first scan result to know which networks might be available\&. That always adds a delay\&.

With ethernet devices, NetworkManager waits for carrier until the configurable
[device*]\&.carrier\-timeout
is reached\&. This is because some devices take a long time to detect carrier and it means to boot with cable unplugged, will unnecessarily delay
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service\&.
