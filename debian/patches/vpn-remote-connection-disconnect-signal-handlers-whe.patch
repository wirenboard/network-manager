Subject: [PATCH 2/2] {vpn,remote}-connection: disconnect signal handlers when
 disposed

GNOME Settings 3.26 is crashing every time a VPN connection changed its
state. After some digging, a debug message was put on dispose, and this
issue was found:

libnm-Message: Object 0x55555633c070 disposed
libnm-Message: Object 0x55555633c730 disposed
libnm-Message: Object 0x55555633eae0 disposed
libnm-Message: Object 0x555556340a80 disposed

Thread 1 "gnome-control-c" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
g_type_check_instance_cast (type_instance=type_instance@entry=0x55555633c070, iface_type=93825006537856) at /.../glib/gobject/gtype.c:4057
4057		  node = lookup_type_node_I (type_instance->g_class->g_type);
(gdb) bt

NetworkManager is calling callbacks on disposed objects, which leads to
crashes in clients (e.g. GNOME Settings).

Fix this issue by disconnecting signal handlers when the objects are
disposed.
